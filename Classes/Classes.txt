Questions

1. Consider the following class:

      public class IdentifyMyParts {
          public static int x = 7; 
          public int y = 3; 
      }

  a. What are the class variables?
      Answer: x

  b. What are the instance variables?
      Answer: y

  c. What is the output from the following code:

      IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
      IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
      a.y = 5;
      b.y = 6;
      a.x = 1;
      b.x = 2;
      System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y);  Answer: 5
      System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y);  Answer: 6
      System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x);  Answer: 2
      System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x);  Answer: 2
      System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x);  Answer: 2
